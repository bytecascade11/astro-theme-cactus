Hey gamers and devs! 🎮👋

Welcome to **Astrotech-Games** – where cutting-edge web tech crashes into the world of gaming.

I'm Chris M. Williams, a developer obsessed with building fast, immersive experiences on the web. From indie game jams to performance-tuned interactive sites, I love exploring how modern tools can level up gaming.

### Why "Astrotech-Games"?
- **Astro**: The ultra-fast framework powering this site (zero JS by default, perfect for snappy game landing pages or portfolios).
- **Tech + Games**: This blog is all about the intersection – game dev techniques, web-based gaming, optimization for smooth gameplay, and emerging tech in interactive entertainment.

The Cactus theme fits the vibe: clean, responsive, with dark mode for late-night coding sessions. Built with Astro, deployed on Vercel – ready for whatever game tech experiments I throw at it.

### What to Expect Here
I'll be posting about:
- Astro for game sites, demos, and web games
- JavaScript/TypeScript in game logic and engines
- Web performance for buttery-smooth experiences (WebGL, Canvas, etc.)
- Tools like Three.js, Phaser, or lightweight frameworks
- Game dev tips, postmortems, and experiments
- Reviews of gaming tech, engines, and trends

Actionable content for devs building games or game-related projects. No spoilers, just code and insights.

If you're into game dev or web gaming, subscribe to RSS, hit me up on X/GitHub, or send webmentions. Let's level up together!

First deep dive coming soon.

🌵🎮🚀
